```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(modelr)
library(tidyverse)
```

modelr is part of the tidyverse suite.

Load it explicitly using library(modelr)

From R4DS:

> It’s important to understand that a fitted model is just the closest model from a family of models. That implies that you have the “best” model (according to some criteria); it doesn’t imply that you have a good model and it certainly doesn’t imply that the model is “true”. George Box puts this well in his famous aphorism: 

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.


```{r}
model_matrix(iris, Sepal.Length ~ Species)

length(mtcars$mpg)

data_grid(data = mtcars, vs, am)

ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) + geom_hex(bins = 50)

```
