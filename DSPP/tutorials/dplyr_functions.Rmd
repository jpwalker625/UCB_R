### This document provides examples of useful `dplyr` functions.

The following examples use the `flights` data from the `nycflights13` package.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# filter (pick their observations by their values)

# arrange (order observations of specified variables)
arrange(flights, year, month, day)

#select (pick out specific columns)

#mutate

```
